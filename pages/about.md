Hi there! I'm Jonathan; A Data Scientist turned ML Engineer. A short resume below.
I've touched most parts of marketing, adtech, machine learning, NLP, LLMs ...etc which includes:
* Spending $80k+ daily on paid ads
* Defining core growth metrics and leading to profitable CAC
* Leading a team of 5 ML engineers to create ML systems for healthcare
* Leveraging LLMs for ranking
* Building text2sql copilots

Before all of that, I did my undergrad at Brown University and grad schools at the University of New Haven and Georgia Tech.
