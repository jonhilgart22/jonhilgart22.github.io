Hi there! I'm Jonathan. A backend engineer with a focus on building ML systems. I did my undergrad at Brown University and grad schools at University of New Haven and Georgia Tech. I've done everything from defining core growth metrics and calculating CAC, to leading a team of 5 ML engineers to create ML systems for healthcare, to leveraging LLMs for ranking. Feel free to reach out; I love to connect and chat!

In my free time, I do a lot of biking around Alameda with my sons Luka and Theo (Luka shown below).
